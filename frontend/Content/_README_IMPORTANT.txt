If you make a change to a CSS file in this folder, check the company-specific 
subfolders first, to see if the file has firm-specific versions.

* If a CSS by the same name as the one you're editing exists in the subfolders,
  ask/determine if the change you're making applies to more than one version. 
  If so, edit all four copies to make your change. If not, make the change only
  to the copy or copies for the company or companies affected.
* If the CSS file you're changing is *not* in the subfolders, *and* the change 
  you're making doesn't apply to all companies, copy the file into all three 
  subdirectories *before* making your changes. Then, find all references of the
  CSS file and change the path to point to the firm-specific subdirectories
  (consult usages of other CSS files for examples).
* If the CSS file you're changing is not in the subfolders, and your change 
  is global across all companies, you may edit the file in the main Content 
  directory without making copies.
